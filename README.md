#  ðŸ’¡ Deep Learning Nanodegree Porjects 




## Here are the five projects, listed for convenience:




1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
2. Dog Breed Classifier
3. Generate TV Scripts
4. Generate Faces
5. Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model






## Prerequisites


We've designed this program such that you only require the following prerequisite knowledge:


### Required


 - [Intermediate Python experience.](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110/lessons/2faaad2c-7904-4752-b289-da787460e159/concepts/6bc01f04-e09b-4406-9026-a6f1ca329eac)



### Optional


- [Multivariable Calculus ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) and [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) if possible.




That being said, we've included a lot of the detailed mathematics for those of you who do want to go in depth and understand the theory behind these concepts. Such content is optional and shouldn't prevent you from doing the projects. However, it is encouraged  for a theoretical understanding.
