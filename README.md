#  ðŸ’¡ Deep Learning Nanodegree Porjects 




## Here are the five projects, listed for convenience:




1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
2. Dog Breed Classifier
3. Generate TV Scripts
4. Generate Faces
5. Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model












## Prerequisites



We've designed this program such that you only require the following prerequisite knowledge:


### Required


 - [Intermediate Python experience.](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110/lessons/2faaad2c-7904-4752-b289-da787460e159/concepts/6bc01f04-e09b-4406-9026-a6f1ca329eac)



### Optional


- [Multivariable Calculus ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) and [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) if possible.




That being said, we've included a lot of the detailed mathematics for those of you who do want to go in depth and understand the theory behind these concepts. Such content is optional and shouldn't prevent you from doing the projects. However, it is encouraged  for a theoretical understanding.






If you haven't used Numpy, Pandas, or Matplotlib before, please take our [Intro to Data Analysis ](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170)course. These are the main tools for working with and visualizing data in Python, so you'll need some experience with them.

### Anaconda


Is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages. You'll also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in your environments. Using Anaconda has made my life working with data much more pleasant.
